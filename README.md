# Minimal Cases for Keebio Nyquist (rev 3.5)

*This is a draft repo! I intend to add more details soon.*

---

This repo is to share designs for a minimalist case I made for my [Keebio Nyquist rev3.5](https://keeb.io/collections/nyquist-keyboard-collection/products/nyquist-keyboard). 

These plates are designed to attach to the internal screwpoints of the Nyquist, to make the most compact but useful package.

The outside corners are drawn with radii to match Work Louder keycaps.

## Files

### Main file 

I currently use `keebio-nyquist-plates-bottom-only.svg` as a bottom-plate-only case for my Nyquist.

I connect it to the PCB with 10mm screws, using little rubber feet as internal standoffs, and 3mm standoffs as nuts above the PCB.

Specifics:
- The 10mm screws are ordered directly from Keebio, by emailing them. 
- The 3mm standoffs were purchased through the normal Keebio website.
- The rubber feet came from Amazon: [HSIULMY Clear Rubber Bumpers Pads, 100 Pcs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NJT6B88)
- The keyboard and its cables fit very nicely into this [Amazon Basics 5" GPS Travel Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I5BUSO)

### Experimental file

The file `keebio-nyquist-plates-with-middle-layer-EXPERIMENTAL.svg` is something I have also cut, but haven't yet put to use.

The idea is to glue the middle layer to the bottom plate, using acetone. I then would superglue 3mm standoffs into the holes of the top plate, to be able to screw on the bottom casing.


## Ordering

I ordered these as a laser cut from [Ponoko](http://ponoko.com), using the 1/8 inch frosted acrylic.

I used a fine-grit sandpaper to roughen the internal surface of the plates, to improve diffusion of lights.

But, to be honest, I don't always use the underglow lights now, so I would maybe order a different color if I were to order again.
